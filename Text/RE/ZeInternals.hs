-- The modules under 'ZeInternals' do not belong to the /official/ regex
-- API, though their contents will so belong if they are listed in the outside
-- `Text.RE` modules. This doesn't mean that they cannot be used but be aware
-- that they may not be as stable or as well documented as the official API
-- modules.

-- If you do notice anything in here that you think we have missed that
